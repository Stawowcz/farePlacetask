I implemented Page Object Model pattern combined with fixtures for data-driven testing in the tests.

In the login.cy.js file, the login tests validCredentials and invalidPassword do not function because, in these cases, a captcha is triggered, which is located within an iframe and a closed shadow-root. The remaining tests in this file cover negative scenarios where I verify the presence of the appropriate errors.

In the filters.cy.js file, there are tests for filters and searching. In here, I also applied data-driven testing, mixing it with dynamically generated data.

Additionally, I have added a file at .github/workflows/e2eTest.yml.

I DESCRIBED ALL IN TESTS AS WELL. BR JAKUB
